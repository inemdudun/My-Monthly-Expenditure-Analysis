## Project Description

In this project I analyzed my personal bank statement data to gain insights into my spending habits, identify unnecessary expenses, and improve my financial planning.i did this by categorizing and visualizing my bank transactions over 6 months from october 2024-march 2025, with this analysis i was able to see a detailed overview of my income, my fixed and variable expenses,saving patterns and my personal expenditure trends. The data is cleaned, transformed and visualized using excel,sql and powerbi. Key metrics such as monthly savings rate, top spending categories, and irregular financial activities are highlighted to support informed decision-making, budgeting and saving strategies.
# Process

- -The dataset was imported in Sql where i continued cleaning and transforming the data. in MySQL i removed unwanted rows and columns,changed date formats and column titles and categorized my expenses using case statements
- i then connected the cleaned table to MypowerBI where i continued data transformation by grouping the date into days,Months and year for time analysis.
- I built a Dashboard in PowerBI to Visualize and Understand my spending habits
